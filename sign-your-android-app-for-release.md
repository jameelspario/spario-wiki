## Configure the build.gradle with signing configuration


You can define the  signing configuration to sign the apk in the `build.gradle` file.

You can define:

- `storeFile` : the keystore file
- `storePassword`: the keystore password
- `keyAlias`: a key alias name
- `keyPassword`: A key alias password

You have to **define** the `signingConfigs` block to create a signing configuration:

```java
android {
    signingConfigs {

        myConfig {
            storeFile file("myFile.keystore")
            storePassword "xxxx"
            keyAlias "xxxx"
            keyPassword "xxxx"
        }
    }
    //....
}

```

Then you can **assign** it to one or more build types.

```java
android {

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.myConfig
        }
    }
}

```
