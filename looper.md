# Looper


A [`Looper`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper.html) is an Android class used to run a message loop for a thread, which usually do not have one associated with them.

The most common `Looper` in Android is the main-loop, also commonly known as the main-thread. This instance is unique for an application and can be accessed statically with `Looper.getMainLooper()`.

If a `Looper` is associated with the current thread, it can be retrieved with `Looper.myLooper()`.



## Create a simple LooperThread


A typical example of the implementation of a `Looper` thread given by the official documentation uses `Looper.prepare()` and `Looper.loop()` and associates a `Handler` with the loop between these calls.

```java
class LooperThread extends Thread {
    public Handler mHandler;

    public void run() {
        Looper.prepare();

        mHandler = new Handler() {
            public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
                // process incoming messages here
            }
        };

        Looper.loop();
    }
}

```



## Run a loop with a HandlerThread


A [`HandlerThread`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/HandlerThread.html) can be used to start a thread with a `Looper`. This looper then can be used to create a `Handler` for communications with it.

```java
HandlerThread thread = new HandlerThread("thread-name");
thread.start();
Handler handler = new Handler(thread.getLooper());

```
