# ExoPlayer



## Add ExoPlayer to the project


**Via jCenter**

including the following in your project's build.gradle file:

```java
compile 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:rX.X.X'

```

where rX.X.X is the your preferred version. For the latest version, see the project's [Releases](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/releases). For more details, see the project on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/google/exoplayer/exoplayer/view).



## Using ExoPlayer


Instantiate your ExoPlayer:

```java
exoPlayer = ExoPlayer.Factory.newInstance(RENDERER_COUNT, minBufferMs, minRebufferMs);

```

To play audio only you can use these values:

```java
RENDERER_COUNT = 1 //since you want to render simple audio
minBufferMs = 1000 
minRebufferMs = 5000

```

Both buffer values can be tweaked according to your requirements.

Now you have to create a DataSource. When you want to stream mp3 you can use the DefaultUriDataSource. You have to pass the Context and a UserAgent. To keep it simple play a local file and pass null as userAgent:

```java
DataSource dataSource = new DefaultUriDataSource(context, null);

```

Then create the sampleSource:

```java
ExtractorSampleSource sampleSource = new ExtractorSampleSource(
                uri, dataSource, new Mp3Extractor(), RENDERER_COUNT, requestedBufferSize);

```

uri points to your file, as an Extractor you can use a simple default Mp3Extractor if you want to play mp3. requestedBufferSize can be tweaked again according to your requirements. Use 5000 for example.

Now you can create your audio track renderer using the sample source as follows:

```java
MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer audioRenderer = new MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer(sampleSource);

```

Finally call prepare on your exoPlayer instance:

```java
exoPlayer.prepare(audioRenderer);

```

To start playback call:

```java
exoPlayer.setPlayWhenReady(true);

```



## Main steps to play video & audio using the standard TrackRenderer implementations


```java
// 1. Instantiate the player.
player = ExoPlayer.Factory.newInstance(RENDERER_COUNT);
// 2. Construct renderers.
MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer videoRenderer = ...
MediaCodecAudioTrackRenderer audioRenderer = ...
// 3. Inject the renderers through prepare.
player.prepare(videoRenderer, audioRenderer);
// 4. Pass the surface to the video renderer.
player.sendMessage(videoRenderer, MediaCodecVideoTrackRenderer.MSG_SET_SURFACE,     surface);
// 5. Start playback.
player.setPlayWhenReady(true);
...
player.release(); // Donâ€™t forget to release when done!

```
